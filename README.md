### Running the demo

The demo was bootstrapped with [create-elm-app](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).  
See that repository for instructions of how to install the `elm-app` command.

To debug the demo locally, run the following from the repository's root directory:
```bash
cd demo
elm-app start
```

To build the demo, run the following from the repository's root directory:
```bash
cd demo
elm-app build
```

### Running tests

For now, because of mysterious package issues with elm-test I don't want to debug,
 tests for the package are in the demo app folder.  To run tests:

```bash
cd demo
elm-test
```
